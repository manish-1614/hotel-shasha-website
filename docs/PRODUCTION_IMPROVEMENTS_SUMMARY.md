# Production Improvements Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Identified & Fixed

- Changed from single repeated image to multiple unique images per room:
  - Deluxe Valley View: `deluxe-valley-1.jpg`, `deluxe-valley-2.jpg`, `deluxe-valley-3.jpg`
  - Premium Mountain Suite: `premium-suite-1.jpg`, `premium-suite-2.jpg`, `premium-suite-3.jpg`
  - Traditional Cottage: `cottage-1.jpg`, `cottage-2.jpg`, `cottage-3.jpg`
  - Family Garden Room: `family-garden-1.jpg`, `family-garden-2.jpg`, `family-garden-3.jpg`
  - Luxury Riverside Villa: `riverside-villa-1.jpg`, `riverside-villa-2.jpg`, `riverside-villa-3.jpg`

**Files Modified:**
