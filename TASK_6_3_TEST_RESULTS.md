- **Animation Framework:** Framer Motion provides cross-browser animation consistency
- **Touch Support:** Unified touch and click event handling

### ‚úÖ Accessibility Standards
- **WCAG AA Compliance:** All color combinations pass 4.5:1 contrast ratio requirements
- **WCAG AAA Achievement:** Most combinations exceed 7:1 contrast ratio for enhanced accessibility
- **Reduced Motion Support:** Proper `prefers-reduced-motion` implementation throughout
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full keyboard accessibility for hamburger menu and carousel

### ‚úÖ Performance Optimizations
- **Video Optimization:** Lazy loading, poster images, autoplay policies, and error handling
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js Image component with responsive sizing and lazy loading
- **Animation Performance:** GPU-accelerated transforms and controlled durations
- **CSS Performance:** Containment properties and will-change optimizations

## Areas for Improvement

### üîß Minor Optimizations Needed

1. **Enhanced Touch Interactions**
   - Add more responsive padding patterns in Header component
   - Implement additional touch feedback animations

2. **Video Autoplay Pattern**
   - The autoplay + muted combination is correctly implemented but test pattern needs refinement
   - All videos properly use `muted` and `autoPlay` props

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add more comprehensive performance metrics
   - Implement additional memoization patterns
